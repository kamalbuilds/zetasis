Zetasis is a no-code cross-chain NFT creation platform powered by ZetaChain.

## Problem Statement
Cross-chain NFTs are crucial for promoting scalability, accessibility, and liquidity. They solve the problem of interoperability between chains by enabling NFTs to move from one network to another, unlocking idle assets across various chains and opening up new opportunities for both creators and collectors. Cross-chain NFTs are a step towards a more integrated and efficient digital asset ecosystem.

As we're headed into a future powered by a ownership-based creative economy, it’s essential for creators to be able to tokenize their content. This allows them to accrue value from their work on-chain - whether that be artworks, in-game-assets, or community memberships. However, it’s no surprise that creators without technical knowledge have a hard time figuring out how to get involved in this new token economy, especially when it comes to creating integrated cross-chain NFTs across multiple networks.

This is why we’ve built Zetasis. Zetasis is a platform that provides the easiest experience for anyone to deploy cross-chain NFTs with no-code onto multiple networks for their choice, all powered by the novel cross-chain NFT technology from the ZetaChain team.
