## Introduction

> The rocks that make up Earth’s ***mantle*** are mostly ***silicates*** — a wide variety of compounds that share a silicon and oxygen structure, National Geographic ([source](https://education.nationalgeographic.org/resource/mantle/))

_Like the scientific fact quoted above, we believe Silicate can help onboard the next-generation, tokenized creator economy on Mantle Network._

Silicate is a no-code NFT minting platform built for the Mantle Network. 

## Problem Statement
In a blockchain-powered creative economy, it’s extremely empowering for creators to be able to tokenize their content. This allows them to accrue value from their work on-chain - whether that be artworks, in-game-assets, or community memberships.

However, it’s no surprise that creators without technical knowledge have a hard time figuring out how to get involved in this new token economy, especially in a newer ecosystem like Mantle Network.

This is why we’ve built Silicate. Silicate is a Mantle Network native platform that provides the easiest experience for anyone to deploy NFTs with no-code and no-fees onto the Mantle Network.
